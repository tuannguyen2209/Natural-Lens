# Natural-Lens #
A powerful deep learning-based software for identifying and classifying animals from images and video streams.

## Introduction ##
AnimalDetect AI is an open-source project designed to provide a fast and accurate solution for animal identification. The model is trained on a large and diverse dataset, enabling it to recognize hundreds of different species with high precision. Especially, typical spicies in Vietnam.
The goal of this project is to bring natural come closer to students, researchers, natural lover,v.v. Moreover, this project helps the researchers and conservationist to locate animal species (which are endanger) around Vietnam. It also help children get closer to animal and keep away phone.
